Well hello world, how are you?  What's that, you got Covid.  Aw, that sucks, hope you been vaccinated and you recover real soon.

I reckon Omicron is gonna sort this pretty soon as it's so contagious that hurd immunity will hopefully happen quickly.  

Hopefully will not cause to much damage as the Omicron variant is significantly less severe.
